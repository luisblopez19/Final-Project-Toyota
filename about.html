        <h1 style="font:'Bebas Neue',cursive;"> My Passion for Toyota</h1>
        <p>
            Growing up Toyota was never a car company that I liked since back then all the kids liked Lamborghini's, Ferrari's or any other foreign maker since those were the cars you thought of when you think of a cool car. As I got into my early teens with the growth of fast and furious my fascination with Toyota grew especially with Brian's 1994 Supra Mark IV. With Tokyo Drift also coming out around that time my interest in cars definitely expanded with the JDM culture really being introduced into the fast and furious universe i was hooked on all things JDM and im thankful for the franchise as it has deepened my love for cars all the more growing up. i still love cars today and hope to own a supra eventually.
